    <a name="checklist" class="bookmark"><h1>Checklist</h1></a>

    <p>When you want to start:</p>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Choose an available issue in Git Hub. &#9660</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In GitHub, go into the /travelagentapp project, and go to <b>Issues</b>. Find an issue that is not assigned (unless you're working with someone on the same issue).
            <br><br>
            If there is a prerequisite (which means you can’t work on this issue until another is completed), then you’ll see a number in the title.
            <br><br>
            For example, if you want to tackle an issue with 1.2 in the title, make sure that 1.1 is completed. Or if you want to tackle 2.2, make sure that 2.1 is completed.</p>
        </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Assign the issue to yourself. &#9660</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Open the issue in GitHub and, on the right, under Assignees, click <b>Assign yourself</b>.
            <br><br>
            If you're working with someone, put your name on it too in case there are questions about the issue later.
            <br><br>
            In the issue, click the gear next to Assignees, and click on your name.</p>
        </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Do a <b>git pull</b> from /develop to grab the latest files. &#9660</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In Git Bash, go to the folder where you cloned the project, and type <b>git pull origin develop</b>.</p>
        </div>            
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Commit and push to your private branch as you progress. &#9660</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In Git Bash, in the project folder, type <b>git commit -m "your-message-goes here"</b>.
            <br><br>
            Try to remember (especially Daniel) that messages should be present tense: "Add" not "Added."</p>
        </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">If you're struggling with something, take a walk/try again or reach out/update the issue. &#9660</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This doesn't always work, but when we literally step away from our computer and get our head out of the problem, our brain might slow down enough to find the solution.
            <br><br>
            If not, reach out to the team, or if life is pulling you away, go into the issue on Git Hub and add the label: <b>Having trouble</b>.</p>
        </div>

    <br><br>
    
    <p>When you want to finish:</p>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Do a <b>git stash</b> to stash your changes. &#9660</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Before you push your finished product up to the /develop branch, remember that someone else may have been working in the same file and pushed up to /develop since you pulled the files down.
            <br><br>
            So you need to re-pull from /develop, but wait. If you do that, you'll overwrite what you just did. That's why we're doing this stash command first. It will shelf your changes.
            </p>
        </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Do a <b>git pull</b> from /develop to grab the latest files. &#9660</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In Git Bash, go to the folder where you cloned the project, and type <b>git pull origin develop</b> to get the latest.</p>            
        </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Do a <b>git stash pop</b> to re-apply your changes and approve them in VS Code. &#9660</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Up above, you stashed your changes, and then re-pulled the files down from Git Hub.
            <br><br>
            Now you are running this command to apply your changes to the files you pulled down.
            <br><br>
            Go into Visual Code and open the file that you changed. VS will ask you to approve the changes.            
            </p>
        </div>            
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Commit and push to the /develop branch. &#9660</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In Git Bash, do a commit and then push to <b>origin develop</b>.</p>
        </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Close the issue in Git Hub. &#9660</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Go to Issues in Git Hub, click on the issue, and click <b>Close Issue</b> at the bottom.</b></p>
        </div>    
    
    <a name="issues" class="bookmark"><h1>Git Hub Issues</h1></a>

    <p>If you find a problem that is outside of the issue you're working on and you can't figure it out, or life is pulling you away from figuring it out.</p></a>    
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Create an issue in Git Hub so that it's not forgotten. &#9660</button></a>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Create an issue in Git Hub with a simple title and plenty of details inside. Adjust the label to Bug or Enhancement.
            <br><br>
            A bug would be something that is not working and an enhancement is something that is working, but should be adjusted.
            </p>
        </div>   

    <a name="discussions" class="bookmark"><h1>Git Hub Discussions</h1></a>

    <p>If you want to post something about the HTML, CSS, or Javascript that everyone needs to know, I set up discussions for each.</p>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Add a comment to one of the discussions. &#9660</button></a>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In GitHub, go into the /travelagentapp project, and go to Discussions.
            <br><br>
            Click on HTML, CSS, or Javascript, and put a comment.</p>
        </div>   

    <a name="branches" class="bookmark"><h1>Thoughts on Local Branches</h1></a>
    
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">I did some testing to understand this better and thought I should share what I learned. &#9660</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Remember that you're commiting changes and then pushing.
            <ul>
                <li>A commit is committing the changes to a local repo.</li>
                <li>A push is pushing that commit up to a remote repo (Git Hub).</li>
            </ul>
            I could commit everything to my local branch called main, and then specify that I want to <b>git push origin daniel</b>.
            <br><br>
            Later, when I'm all done, I can specify that I want to <b>git push origin develop</b>.
            <br><br>
            <b>This is not a good practice</b> because if I forget and just type <b>git push</b>, it will push to main.
            <br><br>
            <mark>A better practice is to work in a local branch that mirrors the remote branch (in my case, daniel).</mark> Then it's clear and you won't make that mistake.
            <br><br>
            Technically, you <i>can't</i> make that mistake because if you just type <b>git push</b>, it won't work and it yells since there's not a default destination for your first name branch.
            <br><br>
            Sidebar: I actually did set a default to make it easier (I went into my daniel branch and did: <b>git push --set-upstream origin daniel</b>), so I can just type <b>git push</b>.
            <br><br>                                
            When I'm all done and ready to push to the branch called develop, I don't want to create a develop branch although I could. I'll just do a <b>git push origin develop</b>.</font>
            <br><br>
